# DSC_Assignment_karate_club
This program is a part of my DSC Assignment.
The code discusses the modularity regulations of the Karate club graph from networkx library and the multicommunity splitting within the graph

Attribution:The modularity objective, modularity matrix B, and spectral bipartition method are
based on standard results; see Newman (2006), “Modularity and community structure in
networks,” PNAS 103(23):8577–8582.
